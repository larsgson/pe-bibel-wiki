# Road map

## Phase 1 - Global

### 1.1 Connect worldwide navigation

#### *making use of already existing worldwide Bible libraries*

The following are potentially usable resources:

- [Door 43](https://door43.org/en/) -> Git content site [here](https://git.door43.org/)
- [fetch.bible](https://fetch.bible/) -> GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/gracious-tech/fetch)
- [Free Use Bible API](https://bible.helloao.org/) -> GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/HelloAOLab/bible-api)
- [Digital Bible Society](https://dbs.org/bibles) (including [find.bible](https://find.bible/en/))
- [Aquifer Bible API](https://www.aquifer.bible/)
- [BibleBrain](https://www.faithcomesbyhearing.com/audio-bible-resources/bible-brain) by FCBH
  
### 1.2 Improve language selector

Using data from existing worldwide Bible libraries, like listed above

## Phase 2 - User Experience

### 2.1 Instant publishing / editing

Navigate to newly published verses or chapters and experience all of it; text, audio, video and pictures in the full context

#### *Navigation data*

On-line tools for editing - for titles in new languages

#### *Local projects*

Connect a working local *"work in progress"* repository to the full global published context - i.e. joint navigation with both such local *(still un-published)* and published content

### 2.2 Introduce multi media publishing templates

This is similar to the [Shell Books in Bloom](https://docs.bloomlibrary.org/shell-books-in-bloom/) but no longer limited to printed books only, but rather fully combined text, audio, video and pictures, while at the same time, additionally, also handling Bible book, chapter and verse navigation.

#### *Published content templates*

This can probably be some extended standard connected to the existing Scripture Burrito audio standard - in order to also include other media formats, like videos and pictures.

There is also a need to extend such a format to indicate how to combine all these media formats, both on the navigation timeline *(for instance, for series and episode)* and for Bible book, chapter and verse navigation.

#### *Local projects templates*

For this to work nicely across various tools, there is a need to implement the solution to this as a gloabl media service

## Phase 3 - Expand Media Content

### 3.1 Extend library section for each langague and each country

#### Connect templates with existing libraries 

By making use of the templates *(Phase #2 above)* and connecting these to all the content from the existing libraries *(Phase #1 above)*, then it should be fairly easy and quick, without much effort, to make a lot of content much more easy to navigate

#### Use existing external service

Make use of already existing published Christian content, for example, on YouTube and other such big library services. Just add standard multi media metadata *(using templates)* according to what is defined under Phase 2 here above, in order to then enable navigation both on the navigation timeline *(for instance, for series and episode)* and for Bible book, chapter and verse navigation.
